# Crypto-DashBoard
A crypto dashboard is a digital platform that lives on a website or an app (either desktop or mobile). Its primary function is to track your cryptocurrency accounts and coins and monitor their historical prices and current values so that you can manage both your crypto assets and related financial plans accordingly.
